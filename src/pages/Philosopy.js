            A group of companies integrated by shared purpose, principles, and

            We believe enduring progress requires better systems of cooperation,

        <section>
          <h2>Why We Chose a Group Structure</h2>
          <p>Modern problems are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Multi-dimensional</li>
            <li>Cross-sectoral</li>
            <li>Long-term</li>
            <li>Institutional, not transactional</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Single companies or isolated services often:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Solve symptoms, not structures</li>
            <li>Compete instead of coordinating</li>
            <li>Fragment knowledge and accountability</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Vasudheva’s Answer</h3>
          <p>
            We designed Vasudheva as a group of specialized companies,
            integrated through:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Shared philosophy and values</li>
            <li>Central governance and IP ownership</li>
            <li>Coordinated strategy and knowledge flows</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This allows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Depth without silos</li>
            <li>Specialization without fragmentation</li>
            <li>Growth without loss of coherence</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        {/* ROLE OF VASUDHEVA HOLDINGS */}
        <section>
          <h2>The Role of Vasudheva Holdings Pvt. Ltd.</h2>
          <p>Vasudheva Holdings functions as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Holding Company – ownership, capital, supervision</li>
            <li>Governance Nucleus – ethics, standards, accountability</li>
            <li>IP &amp; Knowledge Custodian – brands, frameworks, content</li>
            <li>Strategic Architect – long-term direction and system design</li>
            <li>Integrator – aligning subsidiaries, preventing drift</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="note">
            Vasudheva Holdings does not compete with its subsidiaries. It
            enables them.

        {/* FOUNDATIONAL PROBLEM STATEMENT */}
        <section>
          <h2>The Problem We Are Trying to Solve</h2>
          <p>Across societies and economies, we observe:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Persistent systemic errors</li>
            <li>Institutional inefficiencies</li>
            <li>Mistrust between actors</li>
            <li>Fragmentation of knowledge</li>
            <li>Misalignment between short-term incentives and long-term wellbeing</li>
            <li>Ecological and social externalities</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Many of these harms are preventable. They persist not due to lack of
            intelligence or effort—but due to poor system design, weak
            coordination, and inadequate governance.
